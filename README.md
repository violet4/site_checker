# site_checker

I'm not really writing a readme because I don't think anyone will ever use this.. I made it "modular".. for myself..

This project presents an easy way to, at the specified interval, load a webpage/API call and extract some data from it, then present it using a simple but pretty Qt GUI popup.

I work on an online site and projects come and go. I got tired of having to remember to manually check the website and wanted a script to check for me.

Thank goodness I live on Linux now. If I wrote this 5-10 years ago it would have been frozen on macOS using Applescript dialogs. Now it's in Qt6/Pyside6 and therefore cross-platform (as long as you have the necessary dependencies installed).
